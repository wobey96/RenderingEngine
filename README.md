# RenderingEngineVK
The goal of RenderingEngineVK is to be a real-time rendering engine that using a modern graphics API (Vulkan), supports ray tracing, and adheres to modern scalable efficient architecture and design (frame graph). I want to be able to extend the engine in the future with new techniques I discover. Still in the early stages but watch the progress unfold :)  

## Why?
I grew up spending countless hours playing video games and doing engineering projects in my free time with my friends. When it came to graphics, I was always mesmerized by how a computer that talks in 1's and 0's could make such pretty pictures and virual worlds.
